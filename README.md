This is a game project to help me learn python. I have finished the code I just have to redo some of it. 
I was able to make a playable game in python I want to convert the code to C++ soonish. 
The items that the player picks up needs to be changed and when the player picks up a item it needs to be removed from the map.
There needs to be a combat system added to the game because otherwise the player will not engage in combat.
There needs to be a map in the game because without one the player won't know where they are going. 

The most challenging part was creating a list that would keep the characters items and which location the items are stored at. 
The skill of python is able to tranfer to C++ and any other coding langauge. 
I made my code neat(well it is kind of neat and clean) and organized. 
I need to add more functions and add machine learning ai, so that the alien can move as you move.
