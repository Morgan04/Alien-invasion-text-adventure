This is a game project to help me learn python. I have finished the code I just have to redo some of it. 
The items that the player picks up needs to be changed and when the player picks up a item it needs to be removed from the map.
There needs to be a combat system added to the game because otherwise the player will not engage in combat.
There needs to be a map in the game because without one the player won't know where they are going.
